## **Solution**

```
1. Read the text file

Output :

10 21 19 20 23 1 18 13 9 14 7 21 16
```

```
2. Hmm,, these numbers have a maximum limit of 23. 
You could go for ceaser cipher, but that would lead to a rabbit hole.

Since this is a simple question, lets map the numbers to their corresponding position in english alphabet.

Put it inside some number to alphabet converter 

and it gives justwarmingup
