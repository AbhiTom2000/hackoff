## Challenge prompt
```
Okay, here's the deal. We caught the bad guy as he was tring to hide the flag, but he encrypted it, more or less. During our interrogation, we found out that he used RSA encryption to encryt the flag. Our forensic experts have uncovered some of the data he used to do it. Can you work out the rest? 
n = 49143162609134800648101058228802135733371930439144541653038722439355672137401 
e = 7
