### Challenge prompt

```


X was a pioneer of many technologies that has now developed into the backbone of modern society. Apart from the obvious technology-related roles, X was also a theoretical biologist. X's work was indirectly involved in saving over 14 million lives during the War. Although X's works were crucial in winning the War, X never appreciated for it during X's lifetime; partly because of an irrational hatred/prejudice against a group of people that X belonged to, and partly because most of the work was protected under the Official Secrets Act as a state secret. In the late 2000s, the prime minister of the country which prosecuted X for "indecency" issued a public apology for the shameful way X was treated despite the countless contributions of X to the modern world. Who is X? Format of the flag: hackoff{fullname} *full name is required *all letters in lowercase, without spaces, hyphens or underscores
